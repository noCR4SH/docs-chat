Below is a traditional recipe for British biscuits, specifically for classic butter biscuits.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n- 225 grams (8 ounces) unsalted butter, softened\n- 100 grams (3.5 ounces) granulated sugar\n- 1 large egg\n- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n- 300 grams (10.5 ounces) plain flour\n- 50 grams (1.75 ounces) cornflour (cornstarch)\n- 1 teaspoon baking powder\n- A pinch of salt\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Preparation of Ingredients:**\n   Begin by preheating your oven to 180 degrees Celsius (350 degrees Fahrenheit). Line a baking tray with parchment paper to prevent the biscuits from sticking.\n\n2. **Creaming Butter and Sugar:**\n   In a large mixing bowl, combine the softened unsalted butter and granulated sugar. Using a wooden spoon or an electric mixer, cream the mixture together until it becomes light and fluffy in texture.\n\n3. **Incorporation of Egg and Vanilla:**\n   Add the large egg and the vanilla extract to the creamed mixture. Beat well until these ingredients are thoroughly combined.\n\n4. **Sifting Dry Ingredients:**\n   In a separate bowl, sift together the plain flour, cornflour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. This process aerates the flour and ensures an even distribution of the leavening agent.\n\n5. **Combining Ingredients:**\n   Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture using a spatula or wooden spoon. Be cautious not to overmix; a gentle folding motion will suffice until just combined.\n\n6. **Shaping the Biscuits:**\n   Once the dough has formed, you may choose to roll it out on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of approximately 0.5 cm (0.2 inches) and use cookie cutters to create desired shapes. Alternatively, you may simply roll the dough into small balls and flatten them slightly with your hand.\n\n7. **Baking the Biscuits:**\n   Place the shaped biscuits onto the prepared baking tray, allowing sufficient space between each biscuit to account for spreading during baking. Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 10 to 12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.\n\n8. **Cooling:**\n   Upon completion of baking, remove the biscuits from the oven and allow them to cool on the tray for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.\n\n9. **Serving:**\n   Once cooled, these delightful butter biscuits may be enjoyed on their own or accompanied by a cup of tea.\n\nI trust you shall find this recipe both enjoyable and satisfactory.
